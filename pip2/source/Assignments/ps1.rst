Week 1: ends September 7
========================


For this week, you have the following graded activities:

1. Do the mutliple choice questions and exercises in the textbook chapters, including the ones at the bottom of the chapters, below the glossary. Don't forget to click Save for each of the exercises, and always access the textbook by clicking on the link from cTools, so that you'll be logged in.
   
   * Before Tuesday's class: 
   
   * Before Thursday's class:
      * Fill in a little `info about you </runestone/default/bio>`_ and, optionally, upload a picture that looks like how you look in class, so I can start to learn your names.`
      * Sign up for the `Facebook group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/269032479960344/>`_
      * :ref:`General Intro <the_way_of_the_program>`
      * :ref:`Simple Python Data <simple_python_data>` (except for the last section, on getting input from the user, which you can delay until next week)

#. Reading responses
      * For Thursday, read the intro and chapter 1 of "The Most Human Human".

#. Save answers to the exercises in Problem Set 1:
   :ref:`Problem Set 1 <problem_set_1>`

Reading Response
----------------

If you had to convince someone you were human and not a bot, via text only, what would you do?

.. _problem_set_1:

Problem Set
-----------
**Due:** **Sunday, September 7th at 5 pm**

**Instructions:** Write the code you want to save in the provided boxes, and click **save** for each one. The last code you have saved for each one by the deadline is what will be graded.


1. The variable ``tpa`` currently has the value ``0``. Assign the variable ``tpa`` the value ``6`` .

.. activecode:: ps_1_1

   tpa = 0
   
   ====
   import test
   print "\n\n---\n"
   test.testEqual(tpa, 6)


2. Write code to assign the variable ``yb`` to have the same value that variable ``cw`` has. Do not change the first line of code (``cw = "Hello"``), but write code that would work no matter what the current value of ``cw`` is.

.. activecode:: ps_1_2

   cw = "Hello"
   yb = 0

   ====
   import test
   print "\n\n---\n"
   test.testEqual(cw, yb)


3. Write code to print out the type of the variable ``apples_and_oranges``, the type of the variable ``abc``, and the type of the variable ``new_var``.

.. activecode:: ps_1_3
   
   apples_and_oranges = """hello, everybody
                             how're you?"""

   abc = 6.75483

   new_var = 824

   ====
   print "\n\n---\n(There are no tests for this problem.)"


4. There is a function we are giving you called ``square``. It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable callex ``xyz`` the value ``5*5`` (five squared). Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with ``*``.

.. activecode:: ps_1_4
   :include: addl_functions

   # Want to make sure there really is a function called square? Uncomment the following line and press run.

   #print type(square)

   xyz = ""
   
   ====
   import test
   print "\n\n---\n"
   try:
      test.testEqual(type(xyz), type(3))
      test.testEqual(xyz,25)
   except:
      print "variable xyz doesn't have a value at all!"
      

5. Write code to assign the return value of the function call ``square(3)`` to the variable ``new_number``.

.. activecode:: ps_1_5
    :include: addl_functions


    ====
    print "\n\n---\n"
    import test
    try:
       test.testEqual(new_number, 9)
    except:
       print "Failed test: the variable new_number does not exist yet"


6. Write in a comment what each line of this code does. 

.. activecode:: ps_1_6
    :include: addl_functions

    # Here's an example.
    xyz = 12 # The variable xyz is being assigned the value 12, which is an integer

    # Now do the same for these!
    a = 6

    b = a

    # make sure to be very clear and detailed about the following line of code
    orange = square(b)

    print a

    print b

    print orange

    pear = square

    print pear

7. There are a couple more functions we're giving you in this problem set. One is a function called ``greeting``, which takes any string and adds ``"Hello, "`` in front of it. (You can see examples in the code.) Another one is a function called ``random_digit``, which returns a value of any random integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). (You can also see examples in the code.)

Write code that assigns to the variable ``func_var`` the **function** ``greeting`` (without executing the function). 

Then, write code that assigns to the variable ``new_digit`` the **return value** from executing the function ``random_digit``.

Then, write code that assigns to the variable ``digit_func`` the **function** ``random_digit`` (without executing the function).


.. activecode:: ps_1_7
   :include: addl_functions

   # For example
   print greeting("Jackie")
   print greeting("everybody")
   print greeting("sdgadgsal")
   
   # Try running all this code more than once, so you can see how calling the function
   # random_digit works.
   print random_digit()
   print random_digit()

   # Write code that assigns the variables as mentioned in the instructions.

   ====
   import test
   print "\n\n---\n"
   test.testEqual(type(func_var), type(greeting))
   test.testEqual(type(new_digit), type(1))
   test.testEqual(type(digit_func), type(random_digit))

8. Now write code that assigns the variable ``newval`` to hold the **return value** of ``greeting("everyone in class")``.

.. activecode:: ps_1_8
   :include: addl_functions

   ====   
   import test
   print "\n\n---\n"
   test.testEqual(newval, greeting("everyone in class"))
    

9. This code causes an error. Why? Write a comment explaining.

.. activecode:: ps_1_9

   another_variable = "?!"
   b = another_variable()

   
.. activecode:: addl_functions
   :nopre:
   :hidecode:

   def square(num):
      return num**2

   def greeting(st):
      #st = str(st) # just in case
      return "Hello, " + st

   def random_digit():
     import random
     return random.choice([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
